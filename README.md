# Financials
Tools that can help you getting and keeping your financials healthy.

## Spreadsheet budget tool
This tool helps you getting insight in your monthly cash flow. It has four tabs:
- Dashboard (Totalen): the sums and balance of income, expenses and savings
- Income (Inkomsten): a list of all monthly income sources and amounts
- Expenses (Uitgaven): a list of all monthly expenses
- Savings (Reserveringen): a list of all yearly expenses that will be saved for monthly

All tabs are filled with example entries for a quite common Dutch situation. For now, the spreadsheet budget tool is in Dutch only. I will translate this in English soon.


## SpeedBalance bookkeeping
For people who like to keep track on where the money goes and understand bookkeeping, SpeedBalance is a quite easy to learn tool. As a start I added an example with beginning balances. I will add monthly examples soon.

The program used for bookkeeping is available at http://www.speedbalance.nl.

At the moment, the bookkeeping is available in Dutch language only. I'll provide an English translation soon.
